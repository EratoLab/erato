//! Permission helpers for chats and messages
//!
//! Keep this module small and focused. It should expose narrowly scoped
//! helpers that higher layers (API mappers/handlers) can call to decorate
//! DTOs with permission flags. Later, these helpers can be expanded to use
//! richer policy inputs without changing call sites.

/// Returns whether the current user can edit a given chat.
///
/// Current logic: only the chat owner can edit.
///
/// Future: Extend to collaborators/roles/policies as needed. Keep the
/// signature stable so API layers stay unchanged.

/// NOTE: Do not use yet in handlers. We'll extend the message endpoints to
/// run explicit authorization checks when we ship message-level permissions.
