- This rules should be used when trying to adjust DB models
- The files in backend/src/db/entity are auto-generated by the seaORM CLI based on the structure in the database
- If the generated entity files look to be out of sync, they can be regenrated by executing `just generate_db_schema` in the `backend` directory
- To adjust DB models, sqitch migrations should be used. A new one can be generated by running `./new_migration --discription <DESCRIPTION>` in the `backend/sqitch` directory
- For filling out the migration, the newly generated files in the `deploy` and `revert` directories should be filled out
