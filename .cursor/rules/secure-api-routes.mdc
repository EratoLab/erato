description: Describes how to secure API routes
globs: backend/src/server/**/*
---
- API routes should run appropriate `authorize` checks with the `PolicyEngine`
- The policy structure and actions are described via Open Policy Agent Rego in [backend.rego](mdc:backend/policy/backend/backend.rego)
- If available resource kinds or actions need to be extended, this can be done in [types.rs](mdc:backend/src/policy/types.rs)
