# Langfuse

Erato provides support for [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) observability and prompt management.

## Features

### Observability and Tracing

Langfuse integration provides comprehensive observability for your LLM interactions:

- **Trace Capture**: Automatically captures all chat completions as traces in Langfuse
- **Generation Logging**: Records detailed generation information including:
  - Input messages and context
  - Model responses and tool usage
  - Token usage statistics
  - Generation timing and performance metrics
- **Error Tracking**: Captures and reports errors during LLM interactions
- **Session Tracking**: Groups related conversations for better analysis

### Prompt Management

Erato supports Langfuse's prompt management feature, allowing you to:

- **Dynamic System Prompts**: Configure chat providers to use prompts stored in Langfuse instead of static configuration
- **Version Control**: Leverage Langfuse's prompt versioning for better prompt iteration
- **Centralized Management**: Manage all your system prompts from the Langfuse dashboard
- **Multiple Prompt Formats**: Support for both text and chat-format prompts

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

To enable the Langfuse integration, configure the following in your `erato.toml`:

```toml filename="erato.toml"
[integrations.langfuse]
enabled = true
base_url = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"  # or your self-hosted instance
public_key = "pk-lf-..."
secret_key = "sk-lf-..."
tracing_enabled = true  # optional, defaults to false
```

### Configuration Options

For detailed configuration options and examples, see the [Configuration Reference](../configuration#integrationslangfuse) documentation.

### System Prompt Management

To use Langfuse for system prompt management, configure your chat provider with `system_prompt_langfuse` instead of `system_prompt`:

```toml filename="erato.toml"
[chat_provider]
provider_kind = "openai"
model_name = "gpt-4"
# Use Langfuse prompt management instead of static prompt
system_prompt_langfuse = { prompt_name = "assistant-prompt-v1" }

[integrations.langfuse]
enabled = true
base_url = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"
public_key = "pk-lf-..."
secret_key = "sk-lf-..."
```

For detailed information about the `system_prompt_langfuse` configuration option, see the [Chat Provider Configuration](../configuration#chat_providersystem_prompt_langfuse) documentation.

## Prompt Format Support

Erato supports two types of prompts from Langfuse:

### Text Prompts

Simple text prompts where the entire content is used as the system message:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant..."
}
```

### Chat Prompts

Chat-format prompts with multiple messages. Erato will extract the system message:

```json
{
  "type": "chat",
  "prompt": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Langfuse Account**: Sign up at [langfuse.com](https://langfuse.com/) or set up a self-hosted instance
2. **Create a Project**: Create a new project in your Langfuse dashboard
3. **Get API Keys**: Copy your project's public and secret keys from the project settings
4. **Configure Erato**: Add the Langfuse configuration to your `erato.toml`
5. **Enable Tracing** (optional): Set `tracing_enabled = true` to start logging LLM interactions
6. **Set Up Prompt Management** (optional): Create prompts in Langfuse and reference them in your chat provider configuration

## Security Considerations

- Store your Langfuse secret key securely (e.g., in environment variables or a separate `*.auto.erato.toml` file)
- Use appropriate access controls in your Langfuse project settings
- Consider network security when connecting to self-hosted Langfuse instances

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Langfuse integration is enabled but public_key is not set"**

- Ensure both `public_key` and `secret_key` are configured when `enabled = true`

**"Failed to retrieve prompt from Langfuse"**

- Verify the prompt name exists in your Langfuse project
- Check that your API keys have the necessary permissions
- Ensure network connectivity to your Langfuse instance

**"Cannot specify both system_prompt and system_prompt_langfuse"**

- Remove either `system_prompt` or `system_prompt_langfuse` from your chat provider configuration

**"Chat provider uses Langfuse system prompts but Langfuse integration is not enabled"**

- Set `integrations.langfuse.enabled = true` when using `system_prompt_langfuse`
