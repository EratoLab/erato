# Sentry

Erato provides support for [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) tracing and error reporting.

## Configuration

To enable the Sentry integration, the Sentry DSN of the project must be configured in the integrations section:

```toml filename="erato.toml"
[integrations.sentry]
sentry_dsn = "https://public@sentry.example.com/1"
```

## Build configuration

For the Sentry integration to be available, the Erato backend has to be built with the `sentry` feature enabled (enabled by default in our official builds).
