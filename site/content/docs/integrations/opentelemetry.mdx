# OpenTelemetry

Erato provides support for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for comprehensive system observability.

## Features

- **Distributed Tracing**: Captures detailed traces of requests, actor interactions, and background tasks.
- **Standard Compliance**: Fully compatible with the OpenTelemetry standard.
- **Flexible Exporters**: Supports both HTTP and gRPC protocols for sending traces to collectors.
- **Custom Groups**: Allows fine-grained control over logging verbosity for specific subsystems (e.g., Langfuse integration).

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

To enable OpenTelemetry tracing, configure the `[integrations.otel]` section in your `erato.toml`:

```toml filename="erato.toml"
[integrations.otel]
enabled = true
endpoint = "http://localhost:4318" # or your collector endpoint
service_name = "erato-backend"     # optional
protocol = "http"                  # "http" or "grpc"
```

### Configuration Options

For detailed configuration options and examples, see the [Configuration Reference](../configuration#integrationsotel) documentation.

## Tracing Groups

Erato uses a custom grouping mechanism to allow enabling detailed logs for specific subsystems without enabling debug logs for the entire application or manually specifying multiple module paths.

To enable a group, add it to your `RUST_LOG` environment variable or configuration:

```bash
# Enable info logs generally, but debug logs for Langfuse integration
RUST_LOG="info,erato_system::langfuse=debug"
```

Currently supported groups:

- **`erato_system::langfuse`**
