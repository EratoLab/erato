# i18n - Internationalization

## Language detection

The language used for the frontend is chosen based on the user's browser language.

If the user's browser language is not supported, the default language (English) is used.

## Supported languages

The language support is differentiated into two tiers:

- **Tier 1**: First-class support. All translations are human-reviewed by a maintainer with native language proficiency.
- **Tier 2**: Machine-translated

If a language you are looking for is not currently supported, please reach out to us!

**Tier 1 languages**

- `de` - German
- `en` - English

**Tier 2 languages**

- `es` - Spanish
- `fr` - French
- `pl` - Polish

## Translation strings / Theme overrides

The translation strings are stored in `messages.po` files in the `frontend/src/locales/<LOCALE_CODE>` directories.

Individual translation strings can also be overriden on a [per-theme basis](./theming), to allow for customization e.g. to fit organizational branding and communication style.

To do that, create a `messages.po` file in the `frontend/public/custom-theme/<THEME_NAME>/locales/<LOCALE_CODE>` directory, and override the translation strings you want to change.
For this to work, the custom theme must be present during the build process.

Only translation strings marked with the `js-lingui-explicit-id` comment have stable ID and are suitable for overriding.
