# Configuration

## Ways to provide configuration

There are multiple ways to provide configuration to Erato.

All sources are configuration are merged together into one, so configuration can be specified via e.g. `erato.toml`, as well as via environment variables.

As of now, there is no specified precedence order when it comes to values provided for the same configuration key that are provided in different sources.

### `erato.toml` files

The `erato.toml` file is the preferred way to provide configuration for Erato.
The file must be placed in the current working directory of the Erato process.

In the Helm chart, a secret from where the `erato.toml` file should be mounted can be specified via `backend.configFile`.

### `*.auto.erato.toml` files

In addition to the main `erato.toml` file, Erato will also auto-discover all files matching the pattern `*.auto.erato.toml` in the current working directory.

This is useful if you e.g. want to split out all the secret values (LLM API keys, Database credentials) into a different file that is not checked into source control.

### Environment variables

Configuration can also be provided via environment variables.

Though it is not recommended, values for nested configuration can also be provided via environment variables.
In that case, each nesting level is separated by double underscores (`__`). E.g. `CHAT_PROVIDER__BASE_URL` is equivalent to `chat_provider.base_url`.

### `frontend`

#### `frontend.theme`

The name of the theme to use for the frontend.

When provided, the theme must be part of the frontend bundle (usually located in the `public` directory), and placed in the `custom-theme` directory, under the name provided here.
E.g. if `frontend.theme` is set to `my-theme`, the theme must be placed in `public/custom-theme/my-theme`.

See [Theming](./theming) for more information about themes and theme directory structure.

If not provided, the default bundled theme will be used.

**Default value:** `None`

**Type:** `string | None`

**Example**

```toml
[frontend]
theme = "my-theme"
```

#### `frontend.additional_environment`

Additional values to inject into the frontend environment as global variables.
These will be made available to the frontend Javascript, and added to the `window` object.

This is a dictionary where each value can be a string or a map (string key, string value).

This may be useful if you are using a forked version of the frontend, which you need to pass some configuration to.

**Default value:** `None`

**Type:** `object<string, any>`

**Example**

```toml
[frontend]
additional_environment = { "FOO": "bar" }
```

This will be inejcted into the frontend as:

```js
window.FOO = "bar";
```
