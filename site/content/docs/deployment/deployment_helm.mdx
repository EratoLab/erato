# Helm

The primary way to deploy Erato is via the official Helm chart.

## Repository

It is currently published to the repository `oci://harbor.imassage.me/erato-helm-dev`, and tagged with a fixed `0.1.0` version number followed by the Git commit hash.
A new version is published on every commit to the `main` branch.

> [!WARNING]
>
> The repository URL will soon be replaced with a new stable one, and the releases tagged with version numbers matching the application version.

## Usage

To use as a subchart in a chart of your own, where you override the values in a `values.yaml`, add the following to your `Chart.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: erato
    version: "0.1.0-5038d92f711a1aee7cfbeccfde6f17b15c5a9b95"
    repository: "oci://harbor.imassage.me/erato-helm-dev"
```

## `values.yaml` reference

ðŸš§Work in progress ðŸš§

Some example usage can be found in the [`erato-local` chart of our repository](https://github.com/EratoLab/erato/tree/main/infrastructure/k3d/erato-local), that we use as part of our end-to-end integration tests.
